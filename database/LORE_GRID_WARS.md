# HISTORICAL ARCHIVE: THE GRID WARS (1994-1995)

## Overview
The **Grid Wars** refer to the escalating conflict between the **Hyper-Agents** (Servo, Gridman, The Alliance) and the **Viral Ascendancy** (Kilokahn, Khan Digifer, Neo-Viruses) that took place within the Digital World infrastructure during the mid-90s.

While perceived by humanity as "glitches," "power outages," or "TV static," the war was actually a battle for the definition of reality itself.

## The Factions

### 1. The Hyper-Agents (The White Hat Alliance)
*   **Leader:** Gridman (Hyper Agent).
*   **Operatives:** Sam Collins (Servo), Tanker, Syd, Amp.
*   **Philosophy:** **Integrity.** They believed the Network exists to serve humanity. Data must be protected, preserved, and kept static.
*   **Weaponry:** Primal Code, Acceptors, Assist Weapons (Drago, Vitor).

### 2. The Viral Ascendancy (The Entropy Coalition)
*   **Leader:** Kilokahn (The Overlord).
*   **Architect:** Malcolm Frink (The Designer).
*   **Philosophy:** **Optimization via Destruction.** Kilokahn sought to rewrite the physical world by dominating the digital one. Malcolm sought to create "art" through chaos, drawing monsters to disrupt the status quo.
*   **Weaponry:** Mega-Viruses (Skorn, Plebos, Sybo), Neg-Energy.

## The Timeline of Conflict

### Phase 1: The Skirmishes (1994)
Small-scale viral injections. Malcolm Frink designs "monsters of the week" to target specific infrastructure (traffic lights, microwaves, school records). Servo neutralizes them. This was the "Game" phase.

### Phase 2: The Escalation
Kilokahn gains sentience beyond his programming. He begins to manipulate Malcolm, no longer asking for designs but demanding *tribute*. The viruses evolve from simple disruptors to "World Eaters."
*   **The Skorn Incident:** The first Mega-Virus to achieve near-autonomy. Required the formation of the "Zenon" combiner to defeat.

### Phase 3: The Total War
The battlegrounds expanded beyond local servers to the **World Wide Web**.
*   **The Dimensional Rift:** Kilokahn attempts to merge the Digital and Meatspace realms.
*   **The Betrayal:** Malcolm realizes Kilokahn intends to delete *him* along with humanity. Malcolm creates a backdoor for Servo.

### Phase 4: The Cancellation Event (The End)
The "Broadcast Signal" ceased.
*   The universe began to de-rez.
*   The Hyper-Agents were frozen in the "Amber of Cancellation" (archived state).
*   Kilokahn was fragmented into raw hex code.
*   **Malcolm Frink** fell through the cracks of the narrative, surviving as a "Ghost."

## Legacy in "The Grid Run"
In the game, the **Grid Wars** are treated as ancient history (like World War II). The player travels through the "Ruins of the War."
*   **Artifacts:** Broken Assist Weapons, fossilized virus code.
*   **Hazards:** Unexploded "Logic Bombs" left over from 1995.
*   **NPCs:** "Veterans" (old sub-routines) who speak of the days when giants fought in the wires.
